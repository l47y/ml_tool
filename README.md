# Summary
This shiny app serves as a little user interface in porpose of demonstrating some standard tasks of machine learning. You upload a csv file of some example data and you play around with it. Originally I just wanted to make it capable of producing some plots of data but I decided to extend it a little bit. I tested it with the following well known datasets: 
* Titanic data from Kaggle (downloadable here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
* Boston House Prices data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)
* Iris data (available within R).
